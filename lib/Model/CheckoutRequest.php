/**
 * Digital River API Reference
 *
 * If you have a commerce technology in place, the Digital River API allows you to integrate our back-end payments, tax, fraud, and compliance services.  The Digital River API is a RESTful API. That means Digital River designed this API to allow you to retrieve, create, update, and delete objects with the HTTP verbs GET, POST, and DELETE.   You can use the Digital River API in a test environment when you do not want to interact with financial institutions. The API key you use to authenticate a request determines whether the request is in the production environment or test environment.  The Digital River API speaks exclusively in JSON. You should always set the content-type header to `application/json` to ensure the API accepts and processes your requests.  All Digital River API requests are sent to https://<span></span>api.digitalriver.com.  # Explore Digital River Products    <table> <tr>     <td><b>Product</b></td>     <td><b>Description</b></td> </tr> <tr>     <td><a href=\"https://docs.digitalriver.com/digital-river-api/\">Digital River API</a></td>     <td>Explore Digital River&apos;s API suite for Global Seller Services.</td> </tr> <tr>     <td><a href=\"https://docs.digitalriver.com/digital-river-api/payments/payment-integrations-1\">Payment Integrations</a></td>     <td>Explore our payment integration options that allow you to enable payment methods and checkout flows.</td> </tr> </table>   <a name=\"obtaining-credentials\"></a> # Obtaining Digital River API credentials  Before you can start making Digital River API requests, you&apos;ll need to create a test account in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.digitalriver.com/login). Check out our [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.digitalriver.com/digital-river-api/quick-start-guide) for additional information.       <a name=\"authentication\"></a> # Authentication  The Digital River API authenticates requests using API keys.    Digital River provides secret keys (tokens) for production and test environment in the Digital River API. Each secret key uses a prefix. Use the `sk_test_ prefix` for test environment secret keys and the `sk_ prefix` for production environment secret keys. If you want to apply additional restrictions to access and permissions, you can use restricted API keys.  **Important**&colon; Limit access to your API keys to those who need them. Do not store them in a version control system.  The Java library automatically sends your API key in each request when you assign the API key to `DigitalRiver.apiKey`.  You must send all API requests over HTTPS. Calls sent over plain HTTP will fail. Sending an API request without authentication automatically fails.  <a name=\"api-keys\"></a> # API keys  Digital River uses your account&apos;s API keys to authenticate your API requests. If you do not include your key when you send an API request or use an incorrect or outdated key, Digital River returns an error. See [API keys](https://docs.digitalriver.com/digital-river-api/administration/dashboard/developers/api-keys) in the [Dashboard documentation](https://docs.digitalriver.com/digital-river-api/administration/dashboard) for more information.  ## Get your API keys  To [get your keys](https://docs.digitalriver.com/digital-river-api/getting-started-1#step-1-create-a-test-account), sign in to [Digital River Dashboard](https://dashboard.digitalriver.com/). The API keys page displays your public key and secret key.   # Webhooks Webhooks allow developers to be notified, in near real-time, when specific events occur.  When you register your webhook URLs with Digital River, Digital River creates an Event object and sends webhook events that notify your application any time an event occurs.  The Event object includes the event type and the data associated with that event. Digital River sends the Event object to the endpoint URLs you define in [Dashboard](https://dashboard.digitalriver.com/)&apos;s Webhook settings for your account through an HTTP POST request. You can set up multiple webhook endpoints to receive a single event.  See [Creating a webhook](https://docs.digitalriver.com/digital-river-api/order-management/events-and-webhooks-1/webhooks/creating-a-webhook) to learn how to create a webhook.  ## Event logs To view the webhook events, sign in to [Dashboard](https://dashboard.digitalriver.com/) and click Event logs. The Event logs display the event type, event ID, and timestamp for the event.  <a name=\"metadata\"></a>     # Metadata The metadata parameter stores additional, structured information on an object. You can use the metadata parameter to attach key-value data to the following Digital River resources&colon; SKUs, Checkouts, Orders, Customers, Returns, Refunds, and Fulfillments.  For example, you can store your user&apos;s full name and ID on a Digital River Customer object. Digital River does not use the metadata. Your users will only see this data if you choose to show it to them.  **Note**&colon; Do not store any data that identifies a person, their card information, and so on as metadata.  The metadata parameter supports up to 20 keys. Each key name can be up to 40 characters long&comma; and the values can be up to 500 characters long.  # Pagination All API resources that return lists support bulk fetches. For example, you can use the `limit`, `startingAfter`, and `endingBefore` parameters to list orders, customers, and SKUs.  The `startingBefore` and `endingAfter` parameters both use an object ID value to determine the starting point, and the objects appear in the response in reverse chronological order. To return objects listed before the named object, use the `endingBefore` parameter. To return objects listed after the named object, use the `startingAfter` parameter. If you provide both parameters, the request uses only the `endingBefore` parameter.  ## Parameters  <table> <tr>     <td><b>Parameter</b></td>     <td><b>Description</b></td> </tr> <tr>     <td>limit</td>     <td>The maximum number of objects returned. You can specify a value between 1 and 100.</td> </tr> <tr>     <td>startingAfter</td>     <td>This cursor identifies the pagination starting point in the list based on the object ID. For example, if you send a list request and receive 100 customers ending with `xyz`, your subsequent calls can include `startingAfter=xyz` to fetch the next page of the list.</td> </tr> <tr>     <td>endingBefore</td>     <td>This cursor identifies the pagination starting point in the list based on the object ID. For example, if you send a list request and receive 100 objects starting with `xyz`, your subsequent call can include `endingBefore=xyz` to fetch the previous page of the list.</td> </tr> </table>  ## List response attributes  <table> <tr>     <td><b>Attribute</b></td>     <td><b>Description</b></td> </tr> <tr>     <td>data</td>     <td>This array contains response elements. Any request parameter can paginate the response elements.</td> </tr> <tr>     <td>hasMore</td>     <td>When true, there are more elements available after this set. When false, this set marks the end of the list.</td> </tr> </table>  # Request identifiers  A request identifier is associated with each API request. It appears in the response headers under `x-dr-requestid`. Request identifiers also appear in the URLs of each request log in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.digitalriver.com/).  **Note**&colon; Contact us if you have a question about a specific request. To ensure a quick solution, include the request identifier.  # Versioning  Your account&apos;s API version determines the structure of events generated by API requests. All versions with breaking changes are dated.  All requests will use the version pinned to your account API settings. It only changes when you upgrade to the latest API version.   Select a version of the library to change the API version used and create a webhook endpoint with the same API version as `DigitalRiver.API_VERSION` property in the library. Use the [Changelog](https://docs.digitalriver.com/digital-river-api/general-resources/release-notes) to  find the API version you need and view all breaking changes.  You can test a single API request without upgrading your API key.  To set an API version with a specific request, send a `DigitalRiver-Version` header, for example:  `digitalriver-version=2020-09-30`  <a name=\"errors\"></a> # Response status codes  Digital River uses HTTP response status codes. These codes indicate whether an API request succeeded or failed. HTTP status codes group responses into the following classes&colon;  * The `2xx` range indicates success.  * The `4xx` range indicates an error that failed based on the provided information provided (for example, you omitted a parameter or a charge failed).  * The `5xx` range indicates an error with Digital River&apos;s servers.  * You can handle some `4xx` errors programmatically to include an error code that briefly explains the error reported (for example, include an error code when you decline a card).  <a name=\"error-types\"></a> ## Error types  <table> <tr>     <td><b>Type</b></td>     <td><b>Description</b></td> </tr> <tr>     <td>bad_request</td>     <td>The server could not process the request due to a client error (for example, malformed request syntax). Correct the problem and try again.</td> </tr>    <tr>     <td>not_found</td>     <td>The server can’t find the requested resource. No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent.</td> </tr> <tr>     <td>request_timeout</td>     <td>The client did not produce the request within the time that the server was prepared to wait. Resend the request without modifications at any later time.</td> </tr> <tr>     <td>internal_server_error</td>     <td>The server encountered an unexpected problem that prevented it from fulfilling the request.</td> </tr>     <tr>     <td>unauthorized</td>     <td>The request requires user authentication. Resend the request with valid user authentication.</td> </tr>     <tr>     <td>too_many_requests</td>     <td>The user sent too many requests in a given amount of time (&ldquo;rate limiting&rdquo;). The response should include details explaining the condition and may include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait before sending a new request.</td> </tr>     <tr>     <td>conflict</td>     <td>There is a request conflict with the current state of the server.      Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For example, you may get a 409 response when uploading a file that is older than the one already on the server resulting in a version control conflict. </td> </tr>     <tr>     <td>validation_error</td>     <td>Errors triggered by our client-side libraries when failing to validate fields (for example, when a card number or expiration date is invalid or incomplete).  Used by&colon; DigitalRiver.js</td> </tr>     <tr>     <td>no_network</td>     <td>There is no network coverage or cellular data connection.</td> </tr>     </table>  <a name=\"error-codes\"></a> ## Error codes  The following table contains a list of API error codes.  **Note**&colon; Do not share the error's <code>code</code> with customers. Doing so may aid fradulent and malicious actors.  <table> <tr>     <td><b>Code</b></td>     <td><b>Description</b></td> </tr> <tr>     <td>account_closed</td>     <td>Stop all billing as this account is closed.</td> </tr> <tr>     <td>already_exists</td>     <td>The item you tried to create already exists.</td> </tr> <tr>     <td>amount_too_large</td>     <td>The given amount is too large.
